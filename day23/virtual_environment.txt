# We may have different projects in our system that may require different package dependencies.
# Your project1 may have pandas version 2.1 whereas project2 may have pandas version 2.5 in the same system
# So, this arises a problem. If you want to work on project1 then one of packages must be uninstalled from
    # your global system and another version should be installed

# This problem can be solved creating a virtual environments in your system
# Virtual Environment is an isolated environment to keep the packages required for your project.
# It solves the problem of installing and uninstalling packages for different projects in a same system

# Every python project must be done with a virtual environment activated


# Creating a virtual environment
1. python -m venv <environment_name>
    => python -m venv venv

# Activating the virtual environment
2. venv\Scripts\activate => for windows users in command prompt
   source venv/bin/activate => for mac and linux users in terminal

# Deactivating the environment
3. deactivate

# Installing a package in the environment
4. pip install <package_name>
   => pip install pandas

# Listing the installed packages
5. pip freeze

# Creating a requirements.txt file
6. pip freeze > requirements.txt


# Installing packages from the requirements.txt file
7. pip install -r requirements.txt
